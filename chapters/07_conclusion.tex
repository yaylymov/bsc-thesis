\section{Summary}
In this research, it is demonstrated that the capabilities of deepfakes pose both
opportunities for creative fields, technology advancements and threats to information
integrity. Recognizing the increasing importance of this technology, this thesis analyzes
various detection tools and their ability to counter manipulations. A primary focus is placed
on video detection tools such as Deepware, Seferbekov's and NtechLab's tools. Through
comprehensive testing, it was observed that while some tools showcased high Detection
Accuracy and Precision, they might lag behind in other crucial metrics like Recall
and F1-Score. These inconsistencies are important for a various evaluation approach,
considering not just the accuracy but the tool's ability to capture true positives.

Moreover, image detection tools, including AI or Not, Illuminarty and Facetorch, were
also observed. While AI or Not and Illuminarty emerged as the more proficient tool,
possibly due to their consistent backing by dedicated companies and communities.
Even though Facetorch showed potential as an open-source project, it fell behind,
unserscoring the importance of regular updates to keep up with the changing landscape
of deepfake techniques.

The diverse metrics used for assessment - Accuracy, Precision, Recall and F1-Score - illuminated
that no single tool was generally superior in all fronts. Instead, their effectiveness is 
circumstantial, and the optimal tool selection should occur with the specific requirements
of a task.

\section{Future Work}
There are several applicable areas to focus on for future work. One essential area of 
exploration is the expansion of datasets. By testing the tools against diverse and varied
datasets, broader understanding of the tools can be gained. Moreover, testing with a 
larger volume of inputs can offer deeper insights into their scalability, robustness, 
and average performance metrics across datasets. Additionally, the need for regular 
updates and maintenance cannot be understated. As highlighted by the performance of 
tools such as Facetorch, staying updated is crucial to effectively tackle the latest 
deepfake generation techniques. It would be also beneficial to not only keep the 
detection tools updated with the latest versions of these algorithms but also to 
retrain them periodically with updated techniques. By doing so, these tools can 
leverage the most recent advancements in the field. Lastly, a proactive studying the
latest advancements in deepfake generation tools, allowing researchers develop detection
methods based on new innovations, is crucial to this field.

\section{Conclusion}
Even though there's extensive research and numerous competitions focused on deepfake 
detection, no single method can identify them all. The swift advancements in 
deepfake generation could be a reason behind this. Since no approach has consistently 
shown to outpace the deepfake generator in effectiveness, it suggests that the world 
of deepfakes continues to develop. If it reaches a point where detection tools can't 
keep up, distinguishing between authentic and manipulated content might become 
nearly impossible. There's also a concern that if deepfake creators use detection 
tools as standards, it might unintentionally improve the quality of fake content.
The work documented in this thesis is just a starting point among the countless 
opportunities that this field awaits.
