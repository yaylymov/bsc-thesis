With the bond of art and technology, deepfakes are slowly redifing the state of 
entertainment. Their ability to transform audios and visuals offers creators better
possibilities to create new type of content. From refining the quality of amateur
videos to colorizing black and white movies, deepfakes are reshaping the entertainment
and art industries. 


\section{Entertainment and Art}
Deepfakes are popular in many creative areas. For example, a rapper Kendrick Lamar,
used deepfake in 2022 music video to take on looks of famous celebrities. In the 
renewed Star Wars series, deepfake technology was used to resurrect characters like
Princess Leia and Moff Tarkin, despite the original actors having passed away~\cite{motion-analysis}. 

The real question is: Is deepfake technology a blessing or a curse for the talent?
Of course it offers scalability. An actor can feature in global commercials or websites
without constant traveling or learning new languages. For instance, Synthesia\footnote{\url{https://www.synthesia.io/}}
did this with two commercials starring rapper Snoop Dogg. Insead of reshooting for a
rebranded commercial, they altered Snoop Dogg's mouth movements to match the new brand 
name using deepfakes~\cite{wipo-magazine}.
