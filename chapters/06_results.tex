\chapter{Results}\label{chapter:results}
In this chapter, the results of the in \autoref{sec:analysis-tools} computed experinments are 
presented. As previously described, three different video and image detection tools were used
to detect deepfakes. Calculations for the video detection tools were based on the 
FaceForensics++ dataset, along with deepfake videos produced by DeepFaceLab and FaceSwap.
Image detection tools were evaluated using images created by FaceApp and Stable Diffusion,
as well as 20 authentic images.
