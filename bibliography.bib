              codes by training a multilayer neural network with a small central 
              layer to reconstruct high-dimensional input vectors. Gradient descent 
              can be used for fine-tuning the weights in such “autoencoder” networks, 
              but this works well only if the initial weights are close to a good solution. 
              We describe an effective way of initializing the weights that allows deep 
              autoencoder networks to learn low-dimensional codes that work much better 
              than principal components analysis as a tool to reduce the dimensionality 
              of data.}

              creation of what have become known as “deepfakes”: synthetic 
              videos that closely resemble real videos. Integrating theories 
              about the power of visual communication and the role played by 
              uncertainty in undermining trust in public discourse, we explain 
              the likely contribution of deepfakes to online disinformation. 
              Administering novel experimental treatments to a large representative 
              sample of the United Kingdom population allowed us to compare 
              people's evaluations of deepfakes. We find that people are more 
              likely to feel uncertain than to be misled by deepfakes, but 
              this resulting uncertainty, in turn, reduces trust in news on 
              social media. We conclude that deepfakes may contribute toward 
              generalized indeterminacy and cynicism, further intensifying 
              recent challenges to online civic culture in democratic societies.}
