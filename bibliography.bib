Since then, these “deepfakes” have advanced significantly.In this article, we explore the creation and detection of deepfakes and provide an in-depth view as to how these architectures work. The purpose of this survey is to provide the reader with a deeper understanding of (1) how deepfakes are created and detected, (2) the current trends and advancements in this domain, (3) the shortcomings of the current defense solutions, and (4) the areas that require further research and attention.},

  abstract  = {Deepfakes are synthetic content generated using advanced deep learning and AI technologies. The advancement of technology has created opportunities for anyone to create and share deepfakes much easier. This may lead to societal concerns based on how communities engage with it. However, there is limited research available to understand how communities perceive deepfakes. We examined deepfake conversations on Reddit from 2018 to 2021—including major topics and their temporal changes as well as implications of these conversations. Using a mixed-method approach—topic modeling and qualitative coding, we found 6,638 posts and 86,425 comments discussing concerns of the believable nature of deepfakes and how platforms moderate them. We also found Reddit conversations to be pro-deepfake and building a community that supports creating and sharing deepfake artifacts and building a marketplace regardless of the consequences. Possible implications derived from qualitative codes indicate that deepfake conversations raise societal concerns. We propose that there are implications for Human Computer Interaction (HCI) to mitigate the harm created from deepfakes.},

  abstract  = {Recent advancements in machine learning and computer vision have led to the proliferation of Deepfakes. As technology democratizes over time, there is an increasing fear that novice users can create Deepfakes, to discredit others and undermine public discourse. In this paper, we conduct user studies to understand whether participants with advanced computer skills and varying level of computer science expertise can create Deepfakes of a person saying a target statement using limited media files. We conduct two studies; in the first study (n = 39) participants try creating a target Deepfake in a constrained time frame using any tool they desire. In the second study (n = 29) participants use pre-specified deep learning based tools to create the same Deepfake. We find that for the first study, of the participants successfully created complete Deepfakes with audio and video, whereas for the second user study, of the participants were successful in stitching target speech to the target video. We further use Deepfake detection software tools as well as human examiner-based analysis, to classify the successfully generated Deepfake outputs as fake, suspicious, or real. The software detector classified of the Deepfakes as fake, whereas the human examiners classified of the videos as fake. We conclude that creating Deepfakes is a simple enough task for a novice user given adequate tools and time; however, the resulting Deepfakes are not sufficiently real-looking and are unable to completely fool detection software as well as human examiners.},

  abstract  = {Face swapping in images is a process where an input identity is transformed into a target identity while preserving the former's facial expression, pose and lighting. In this paper, a new face swap method using autoencoder networks is investigated, which can capture the two different image sets to be trained. The images from two sets are unstructured collection of people's photographs. This approach is enabled by framing the face swapping problem in terms of style transfer, where the goal is to render an image in the style of another one. We design a new autoencoder network that enables the processing to produce photorealistic results. Moreover, in low resolution video, the proposed method can achieve face swap by combining autoencoder network with pre- and post-processing steps.},

  abstract = {Artificial Intelligence (AI) now enables the mass 
              creation of what have become known as “deepfakes”: synthetic 
              videos that closely resemble real videos. Integrating theories 
              about the power of visual communication and the role played by 
              uncertainty in undermining trust in public discourse, we explain 
              the likely contribution of deepfakes to online disinformation. 
              Administering novel experimental treatments to a large representative 
              sample of the United Kingdom population allowed us to compare 
              people's evaluations of deepfakes. We find that people are more 
              likely to feel uncertain than to be misled by deepfakes, but 
              this resulting uncertainty, in turn, reduces trust in news on 
              social media. We conclude that deepfakes may contribute toward 
              generalized indeterminacy and cynicism, further intensifying 
              recent challenges to online civic culture in democratic societies.}
